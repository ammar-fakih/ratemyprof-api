Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.\n",

This seminar serves as an introduction to the history and practices of black comic cultures, and focuses on major themes, styles, and historical events that inform contemporary genres of black comedy. We will use comedy as a means to help us think about how American cultures and identities have been shaped, challenged, and transformed by way of performance.",

Specific areas of inquiry and discussion will include: Asian/American engagements with critical Asian and diaspora studies, relationships to Indigeneity and settler colonialism, U.S. militarism and empire, and questions of cultural and place-based memory.",

Students will become familiar with basic concepts and qualitative methods in the \nsocial sciences, including ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of face-to-face communication. \nWe look for ways of answering questions such as these:\n\nÂ• How do everyday conversational practices create solidarity between people, or set them apart from \none another? How does talk reflect and create relations of power?\nÂ• How do words combine with other semiotic modalities (gesture, facial expression, prosody) to \nconvey subtle messages?\nÂ• Why do miscommunications arise, even between people who speak the same language?\nÂ• How do children learn to speak not only grammatically, but also appropriately?\nÂ• How does language shape our thoughts or the ways we perceive the world?\n\nIn this course, we explore language  as a complex form of social actionÂ—not merely a vehicle for \ncommunicating thoughts and meanings, but a means of creating the social world. We consider ways \nthat language acts on us, and ways that we act through language: achieving relationships, \nconstituting identities, constructing norms and patterns of thought, and positioning ourselves and \nothers in relation to global systems of power and inequality.\n",

The central premise of this course is that colonialism is an ongoing process in many parts of the world; we will examine how it operates through sites such as sovereignty, land and territory, medicine, gender and sexuality, and others. At the same time, we will look at how indigenous practices and movements have sought to carve out spaces for critique and resistance.",

        "summary": "What does it mean to be rational? Does it mean anything, to say that you are thinking rationally? This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, 'scientific rationality' -- as we will call it for the moment -- is 'located.' What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compelling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps 'at work' even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer thee questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic -- the elements of 'scientific rationality.' Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for 'us' what is 'irrational.' Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that 'do' science act, think, and make knowledge.

In addition to (i) examining several case studies of controversies over campus speech and (ii) reading key texts that make the case for academic freedom, the course also engages in the praxis of teaching important artistic, political, and scholarly works that push, or perhaps cross, the boundaries of permissibility for classroom teaching in our own time and place.  These works include Joshua Cohen's novel, The Netanyahus, Radu Jude's film, Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, and one or more ethnographic texts concerned with social worlds in which normative behavior would lead to severe sanctions if it occurred here (on our Claremont Colleges campus) and now (in spring 2023).",

Students will learn about the changing relationship of anthropology to visual practices through a number of screenings, readings and lectures that explore issues of power and representation and the visual medium.",

We will explore how and why avant-garde artists engaged with nation-building programs, valorized Amerindian and Afro-descendent cultures, and challenged colonial notions of race and gender. We will also discuss historical and contemporary debates about the political and social role of the avant-garde, especially artists' ties to their literary counterparts and to political radicals. We will investigate works in a range of artistic media (painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, conceptual, installation, and performance art) alongside artist statements, manifestos, and classic theories of the avant-garde.",

We will start by theorizing hypersexuality and Asian women on screen by thinking about the role militarism plays in constructing gendered and\nracialized stereotypes. We will continue thinking about ongoing representational practices of Asian/American women by watching films, TV shows, comedy specials, news clips, and social media. We will consider how engaging and analyzing representation as a site of contestation and\npossibilty might create opportunities for rethinking the political power of Asian American media. ",

        "summary": "To many, Chinese cuisine is synonymous with spicy food. Did you know that the Chile peppers now widely used in Chinese cooking were introduced in the region only in the 16th century? This course introduces social and historical developments using culinary history as a prism. What do cooking and food habits tell us of Chinese culture? We will explore these topics through a variety of media ? primary sources, newspapers, photographs, paintings, and movies. The course is divided into sections on the history of food; primary sources and representations of food; and Chinese food outside China. The last four weeks will concentrate on food culture in Shanghai in the last century. ",

The two courses together cover the topics in and provide an alternative to General Chemistry II (CHEM015L KS) and Introductory Biology (BIOL043L KS) and highlight areas of overlap between the two disciplines. For example, Chemistry topics would include free energy, equilibrium, kinetics, electrochemistry, and acid-base chemistry. Biology topics would include introductory material in the fields of cell biology, biochemistry and genetics, including cell structure, metabolism, gene expression, and inheritance. In total, BIOL042L KS and CHEM042L KS will include 6 hours of lecture and 6-8 hours of lab per week. This course has a lab fee. Students must enroll in this course and CHEM042L KS concurrently.",

Ongoing threats such as catastrophic climate change and pervasive human footprints through agricultural land use or resource exploitation pose major challenges to sustaining biodiversity. Ultimately, the threats facing species and ecosystems are driven by human behaviors and societal decisions alongside ecological processes. Finding solutions therefore requires inter-disciplinary theories, concepts, and skills. This course will introduce students to a broad range of techniques that are relevant to conservation biology and science ranging from mathematical biology to community ecology to the social sciences. The course will be centered on discussions and collaborative group work. In this course, students will also learn key computational and data science tools used by conservation scientists and will apply these skills in individual and group projects.

We will refer to the 'epicentro' or 'epicenter' to signal both a spatial and symbolic space that problematizes how Central American identities and subject positions destabilize dominant understandings of the 'Latino' experience in the United States. Focusing primarily on diasporas from the Northern Triangle, we will critically interrogate the relationship between the United States and Central America, examining how geopolitics and US-Central American international relations have shaped the trajectories of Central American immigrant communities and their presence/incorporation in U.S. society. Importantly, students will also gain a critical understanding of Central American identities, particularly as these have been constructed through the intersection of race, gender, sexuality, and legal status and through transnational economic, political and cultural networks.

By considering Latina literature in  particular  and  its  engagement   with   multiple  feminisms,   we   will   see a  landscape   marked  by contradictions  and  conflict  with  ?First  World?  feminism  and  determined  from  within  by  culture, colonialism, history, and geography. Our attention to literary renderings of the feminist experience will be informed  by  a  recurrent  emphasis on representations  of  history  and  issues  of  gender,  terms  that  can  be understood  culturally,  historically,  economically,  racially,  and  geographically.  From  Old  World  Lit  to Chica  Lit,  we  will  ask  ourselves  how  the  models  of  womanhood  and  female  liberation andautonomy presented in these texts align themselves and/or challenge U.S. American, Latin American, European and Latina feminisms to date. We will question whether the shifting constructions of sexuality, gender roles, and family/inter-generational tiescombined with the experience of immigration, transmigration, hybridity and  border  culture  fashion  a  new  Latina  subject  emerging  within  the  realities  of  consumerism  and globalization.",

Here, through close reading and discussion of battlefield harangues and Assembly deliberations, of despotic tyranny and democratic nudging, we will explore together the contours of these ancient Greek conversations as leadership evolved and eventually began to be theorized. Our seminar readings will include both modern scholarship and ancient sources, the latter drawn primarily from Homer's Iliad, from the historiographies of Herodotus and Thucydides, and from the writings of the fourth-century scholar-warrior Xenophon (including his Socratic Memorabilia, his campaign memoir Anabasis, and his Cyropaedia, an extended meditation on the ideal leader).

We will use climate change as an opportunity to explore the impact of our work on society. There are four primary components of that exploration: critical analysis of the social context of STEM, the expansion and application of concepts from the core to understand this social-technical problem, collaborative projects that promote positive change in the world, and communicating our project designs and professional choices. Plenary sessions will explore topics such as environmental justice, earth system science, the relation between expertise and power, policy processes, data science, community engagement, multidisciplinary collaboration, impactful careers, and science communication. Individual sections will explore particular climate-related issues in greater depth. Final team projects will challenge students to apply these concepts in proposals for climate solutions. This is a Core course open to HMC sophomores only. Prerequisites: Completion of all other HMC Core courses.",

The reason is two-fold: 1) while machine learning models are getting more robust, they are also getting larger and more complex 2) application demands can be extremely strict; for example, self-driving cars must use the result of running models to make decisions in real time. This course will explore how to build machine learning systems that are resource-efficient, deployable, and scalable. We will explore methods to lower resource usage through paper reading and a semester-long project. For the project, students will set up a machine learning system, analyze its resource usage (computation, memory, energy, etc), and aim to improve its efficiency. While this course will guide students through setting up machine learning models, its focus is on system design and it will not cover machine learning theory.

This dual perspective enriches understanding on both sides, and informs the development of practical algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. Along the way, we will revisit important ideas from calculus and linear algebra, emphasizing a visual understanding that complements the more traditional algebraic treatment. The course provides essential mathematical background along with real-world examples and applications. It also provides a short survey of recent developments in digital geometry processing and discrete differential geometry. Topics include: curves and surfaces, curvature, connections and parallel transport, exterior algebra, exterior calculus, StokesÂ’ theorem, simplicial homology, de Rham cohomology, Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, conformal mapping, finite element methods, and numerical linear algebra. Applications include: approximation of curvature, curve and surface smoothing, surface parameterization, vector field design, and the computation of geodesic distance.

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.\n",

A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like 'Dancing with the Stars,' or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes.",

Today, the increased availability of cheaper food, larger portion sizes, the reliance on high calorie,\nprocessed ingredients, the types of food available in many communities, government policies, and lifestyle choices have led to an\nepidemic of food-related health problems. At the same time, many Americans struggle with food insecurity due to wage stagnation\nand economic disruptions. Food systems are both major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly vulnerable to\nclimate change. The sustainability of human civilization hinges on the resilience of our food systems. In this course, we develop an indepth understanding of food systems - the people, processes, and resources that move our food from farm and ocean to plate.\nStudents learn how to analyze food system issues, from food production and distribution to food insecurity and public policy.",

        "summary": "Where you live impacts how well and how long you live. Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Letter grade only.",

Students are furthermore introduced to the predominant environmental protection standards (efficiency, safety, and sustainability) and will in this context explore how individual initiatives are measured and evaluated against each standard. Finally, the course provides insights into the exploitation and valuation of natural resources and ecosystem services.

In the course, we will study fundamental forces that drive sociality at multiple levels, from viruses to markets. We will uncover some of the hidden mechanisms that rule our social universe. For example, we will discover why genes form chromosomes, why people form nations, and why the reasons for the two are similar. The emphasis will be on a few key ideas that have broad and profound application. In our journey, we will learn from where social systems evolved and perhaps to where social systems may be evolving. Additional time will be devoted to professional self-examination and prioritization.",

In this course, we investigate health related behavior using techniques from sub-fields of economics including industrial organization, labor economics, information economics, public economics, and behavioral economics. We exmaine the health care industry in the U.S. and the argument for reform, and consider alternative models such as those used in other developed countries. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the basic tools to better understand health and health care fields from an economic perspective. Prerequisite: ECON052  PO.  ",

We discuss most of the major financial decisions made by corporate executives both within the firm and in their interactions with investors. Essential in most of these decisions is the process of valuation, which will be emphasized throughout the course. Topics include investment criteria, valuation of financial assets and liabilities, relationships between risk and return, capital structure choice, payout policy, as well as valuation and capital budgeting for the levered firm.

The first part of the class will focus on understanding the causes and consequences of poverty, along with the different policies that have been used to address these issues. We will then consider issues of inequality such as measurement, trends, and consequences. The final part of the course will focus on racial inequality and discrimination. Several theoretical models of discrimination will be developed and then evaluated within the context of the current empirical work. Finally, we will consider the various connections between the discrimination literature and the broader issues of poverty and inequality discussed at the outset of class.  Prerequisite: Econ 101.",

This course provides context for current debates and\ncontroversies surrounding the theory and practice of aÂ€ÂœtranslationaÂ€Â�: a word that, in English,\nliterally means aÂ€Âœto carry across.aÂ€Â� Centering contemporary BIPOC writers and translators, we\nexamine and emulate how translation in the 21st century problematizes traditional approaches.\nThrough forms of creative and scholarly inquiry, we will act as translators attentive to the\nfollowing questions: Who is being translated into English today, and why? How does translation\nmediate the encounter of distinct cultural contexts and colonial histories? What role does\ntranslation play in resistance and projects of emancipationaÂ€Â”or assimilation? How do processes\nof translation reconfigure existing power relations, particularly when the target language is\nEnglishaÂ€Â”the colonial language of finance capital and militarized geopolitical power? How is\ntranslation constrained by institutions, long-standing narratives surrounding market demands (or\nlack thereof) for literature in translation, and stereotypes based on national and/or racialized\nidentities? How do translators work around these constraints, individually and collectively? What\nnew possibilities do digital technologies and media offer translatorsaÂ€Â”and global readerships?\nThis course is both theory and praxis based, and there will be an emphasis on how culture(s), in\naddition to language(s) get translated. Though having some previous background in a language\nother than English is welcomed, it is not necessary to participate in the course",

What desire, what longing, what pain escape our ability to represent? How can we use the form of the essay to gesture toward what is missing, what cannot be represented? To explore these questions, we?ll take up a form of writing called ekphrasis: the verbal representation of a visual representation. Ekphrastic essays use the essay's inherent doubt, play, and critical force to ask what goes unnoticed, to demand we look again, look harder. We?ll read Walter Pater on the ?vampiric? Mona Lisa and Virginia Woolf on war photography; watch Derek Jarman's ekphrastic film on AIDS, sexuality, death, and the color blue and John Akomfrah's ?cine-essays? on colonial brutality, human trafficking, climate disruption. Projects include writing ekphrastic essays and trying out multimedia ekphrases (photography, film, digital).   \n",

In this seminar, we examine several nineteenth-century novels that offer a last will and testament as a model for their own operations. These works imagine the novel as a harbinger of the author's death and a vehicle for literary immortality. Yet they also explore how those who lack literacy, property, or institutional power may leave marks on their environment. Through close study of such works as the anonymous novel The Woman of Colour, Charles Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, George Eliot's Middlemarch, and Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, we will consider the role of legal instruments in fiction and the feasibility of imposing one's wishes beyond death.",

We will focus primarily on writing about and from the Anglophone/postcolonial world, and we will query how narrating colonized places as empty, backward, or undeveloped served as part of the political project of colonization itself. We will also consider how domestic spaces are a sort of ?nowhere??where labor is repeated, invisible, and disappearing?and will query how gender contributes to visibility of place. Students will study novels, poetry, and films alongside criticism that engages urban/rural studies and postcolonial theory.",

This course follows a transhistorical path, from the creation of the building in the twelfth century (April 1163) until the recent fire (April 15, 2019), and the beginning of the process of renovation. Why is this cathedral important for French identity? To answer this question, we will read and analyze historical texts, look at the literature (novels, opera, poems etc.) that take Notre-Dame as its main topic, and discuss paintings, sculpture, and architecture as well as photography.  Focusing on more recent and contemporary issues having to do with Notre-Dame (from its Napoleonic re-birth, to its Macronic re-construction), the course will also question the place of religions in France, as well as questions of politics and economics. Multimedia and trans-disciplinary, this course will ground you in centuries of French history and culture while giving you insights into France today. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: FREN044  PO.",

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?",

We will discuss how gender-variance enables contestations of colonial-imperial and racializing ideologies of gender. To these ends, we will center the intersectional dimensions of gender-variance by examining its interlocking and co-constitutive relations with race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, disability, mobility, and citizenship. Given trans studies' critiques of academic disciplinarity and nation-based analytical frameworks, this course will embrace transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transnational approaches.

        "summary": "The Tragic History of the Sea: Portuguese Empire and the Early Modern World. How do we account for the timing, pace, and geography of European imperialism? Histories of colonialism tend to privilege the enterprises of Spain, England, and France. Yet in the long sixteenth century, the small kingdom of Portugal was one of the preeminent colonial powers, with extensive if dispersed conquests in Africa and Asia, and a burgeoning plantation-colony in Brazil. This course examines Portugal, the Portuguese Empire, and the trans-imperial borderlands as an entree into thinking about the First Age of Globalization, c. 1500-1800. We look at the genesis of the Portuguese Empire; relations between colony and metropole; the involvement of other Europeans in the imperial project; and the experience of Portuguese missionaries both within and beyond the borders of the empire. The course concludes by considering the legacies of the Portuguese imperial moment. Particular focus will be on contrasting the imperial experiences in Asia, Africa, and South America. Sources include poems, novels, travel narratives, contemporary histories, archival documents, and a range of secondary literature.\n",

During the past thirty or so years, scholars of modern Europe have begun to question the degree to which these regimes really were ?totalitarian? in their expression of power. This seminar, therefore, is designed to explore the political and cultural histories of twentieth century Europe's totalitarian regimes, including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and others via the analytical lenses of various types of foodstuffs and beverages. Ranging in topics from the production of geneticallymodified strains of wheat to the politics of women's labor and consumption (public/private responsibilities, shopping and cooking, resistance and non-compliance via eating and drinking, etc.) to, finally, the regulation and enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, we will explore these societies ?from above? and ?from below? by evaluating the degree to which everyday eating and drinking impacted both the construction of these notorious dictatorships and the on-the-ground realities of everyday, quotidian experience. \t",

In its pages are unforgettable tales of triumph and failure, heroism and betrayal, love and grief, and of encounters with martial heroes, mythical birds, and otherworldly demons.  As an epic it opens a window into the Persianate world, spanning Iran, India, and Central Asia, bringing its cultures into view.  This course covers the entirety of the epic in translation and explores the overarching themes running through it.  It further details the material culture and illustrated manuscript tradition of the Shahnameh and its reproduction in medieval and early modern Islamic courts where it endured as a princely manual on empire and kingship.",

We will then explore works that draw on the range of methodologies used in writing African History: including archaeology, linguistics, oral history, ecology, anthropology, and area studies. Topics will span Africa's early past (the Sudanic empires of West Africa, Bantu migration, trans-Saharan trade); Atlantic and Indian Ocean slavery and the slave trade; race and racialization in African studies; twentieth-century transnational movements and anticolonial politics; and the ethics of speculation in post-colonial histories. Equipped with familiarity in both foundational and newly published works, students will be encouraged to think as historians across disciplines, to read academic texts for both argument and method, and to think expansively of what archives can be.",

By the end of the twentieth century, that number had dropped to less than one percent. This course examines the ending of European empires in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. Themes addressed include theories of imperialism and decolonization; anti-colonial nationalist and internationalist movements; the roles of violent and non-violent resistance; European domestic politics and international agreements; cultural imperialism; post-colonial immigration; the legacy of empire and decolonization; and the persistence of imperialism in the twenty-first century.",

Is its lesson primarily instructive, to teach us that the past either repeats itself or is constituted by unique events? Does history provide critical distance to help us reflect on the present maelstrom of political rancor and division? Or might its uses even be emotional or psychological, offering comfort and shelter from a harsh contemporary reality? This course will consider these questions and others through a reading of historical monographs dealing with a variety of topics, time periods, and places.",

Students will learn the main tenets of theoretical paradigms advanced by postcolonial theorists and attain proficiency with the terminology of the field (ex. hegemony, subalternity, orientalism, hybridity, contamination, conviviality, etc.) emerging across geographies and disciplines from the 1950s to the present. The course will problematize the relationship of postcolonial theory as a field to discourses in feminist theory, globalization and transnationalism and application of the theories to real-world situations.

In this course, we will use critical theories (including critical race theory, feminism, Marxism, and others) to understand the entangled issues behind this and other persistent inequities.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help fulfill the HMC mission statement more completely by empowering students to be engaged, critical, and civic-minded participants who can positively impact society.\n\nThis class will have a reasonable out-of-class homework requirement that will be commensurate with a one-unit course.",

Ferrante, not of immediate success in Italy where her works were originally published, quickly gained international readership with the translation of her tetralogy, L'amica geniale. The effect of Ferrante's international success has resulted in what scholars are coining 'the Ferrante effect,' an increased attention to works by women writers. In the first half of this course, we will read narratives by and about Elena Ferrante, as well as watch cinematic and serialized adaptations of her work. In the second half of the course, we will explore 'the Ferrante effect,' reading authors, such as Anna Maria Ortese, Igiaba Scego, and Claudia Durastanti, who have gained or regained recognition through republication or translation as part of 'the Ferrante effect.' In reading these works, we will question what they have to offer a global audience, what it means to be a 'woman writer,' and if we can consider 'the Ferrante effect' a trans-national feminist movement. Course is taught in Italian. ",

We'll also read short fiction by well-known contemporary writers, with an eye toward what makes these stories original, entertaining, and complex.  In class, we'll look beyond basic elements of craft and address issues of concern for the experienced writer.  How do we avoid cliche?  Create narrative drive?  Take risks with form, language, and subject matter? Written exercises will focus on these issues while challenging students to push their writing in unexpected directions. May be repeated once for credit. May count toward the CMC literature major only once. Prerequisite: LIT 038 CM.  ",

Much of the term will be devoted to weekly exercises as preparation for later 'free-assignments.' Poems by students will be discussed in a 'workshop' format with attention to the process of revision. Class time will also be spent on assigned readings and issues of craft. Students will be asked to regularly memorize and recite poems. A final portfolio of six thoroughly revised poems will be required for completion of the course.\n\nTo request permission to enroll, submit to hcole@cmc.edu three poems with a cover letter (including your name, email address, a list of literature and creative writing courses taken to date, favorite poets, other reasons you wish to enroll in this poetry workshop).",

ML is becoming a familiar presence in our lives; computer scientists and developers introduce new applications every day for chatting with humans, recommending the best course of action, and making predictions about the future. In spite of all the press, ML remains daunting to non-specialists. This class seeks to mend this divide. This class will introduce ML concepts to students without prior experience and provide templates to get students working in ML right away. We will study and remake artworks by Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler, Sougwen Chung, Memo Akten, Helena Sarin, Tom White, and others. They will use techniques such as image segmentation, CycleGAN, pix2pix, and Tensorflow. Students will propose and work on a larger project in the last third of the class.

This course examines some of the key factors that have contributed to the horror genres capacity to maintain its continued viability in popular culture across a wide range of media including graphic novels, video art, and interactive gaming. Beginning with the modern period of the American horror film and then expanding beyond its physical and ideological borders, this course is designed to encourage students to challenge the ideas that have become associated with the term 'horror,' and to consider whether some other term or terms may be better suited to describe the types of feelings horror films and its related forms of media actually inspire. We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response? Is it possible to locate cinematic representations of horror and its experience outside of the horror genre? Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, or MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO or equivalent.

Pilates is an abdominally based workout that is designed to create postural strength focusing on the abdominal as well as the small intrinsic muscles that support our spinal column. The entire theory of Pilates is developed around the idea of lengthening the muscles as they contract. The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals. This type of activity increases strength and flexibility around the spinal column as well as other major muscle groups. The practice of Pilates is designed to stimulate the proper neurological innervation to create a deeper sense of symmetry. P/NP only.

This has always been the case, but over the past century theorists have interrogated the relationship between art, power, and politics with increasing urgency. In our contemporary world saturated with images, how do they instantiate or challenge relationships of power? If the artist is but a product of social forces, how should we then conceive of the artwork? How is it possible to analyze racialized and gendered power dynamics aesthetically? Movements covered will include post-structuralism, French feminism, the Frankfurt School, and Black aesthetics.",

Our class will study that period while also de-centering it. We will frame our philosophical questions initially from a look at Buddhist and Islamic metaphysics.

We will achieve these insights through a survey of thinkers, writers, and people who address themes such as traditional Africana thought, black existentialism, black feminism, post colonialism, whiteness, double consciousness, and Afro-pessimism.\nCross-listed as AFRI121 AF.\n\nStudents should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.

To explore these questions, this course will make stops at important moments in the history of philosophyÂ—such as Descartes' armchair philosophizing and Carol Gilligan's interviewing women about moralityÂ—on its way to the present movement called 'experimental philosophy,' wherein philosophers conduct experiments similar to those in cognitive and social science in order to address philosophical questions. Students will learn how philosophers think about intuitions and the roles they play in grounding and challenging theories in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc. In addition, students will explore important intersections between philosophy and science, such as the emergence of neurophilosophy and moral psychology in the 20th century. The armchair isn't going anywhere, but neither is the question of which methods of inquiry, namely those empirically informed, are part of the philosopher's toolkit in addressing diverse questions about mind, knowledge, and morality.",

Rotational motion is treated, including angular momentum, torque, cross-products and statics. Other topics include rotating frames, pseudoforces and central-force motion. Simple harmonic and some nonlinear oscillations are discussed, followed by waves on strings, sound and other types of waves, and wave phenomena such as standing waves, beats, two-slit interference, resonance and the Doppler effect.",

However, the rise in executive power has not satisfied expectations, leading to the confounding dual problem of presidents purportedly having too much power in some domains, while still struggling to adequately fix society's most pressing demands. This course will explore the aforementioned conundrum and the historical development of the U.S. executive branch, spotlighting the important contributions- and idiosyncrasies- of every U.S. president.

While retaining these core features, modern conservatism has proven highly dynamic in its adaptation to the capitalist market order and mass democracy, giving rise to right-wing populism, authoritarianism, and free-market conservatism. This course will read conservative thinkers alongside historians and social theorists. Themes include racial supremacy, gender hierarchy, nationalism, violence, and the rule of law. The historical focus of the course will be on US conservative movements, from the new right to the alt-right, and the election of Donald Trump.",

This course is being taught as an inside-outside class at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco, California. Institutions like CRC are highly racialized environments. Thus, the focus of this class is relevant for our setting as well as for understanding contemporary American politics where race has become a defining issue. Although racial exclusion had been a defining element in Latino history, a critical factor that we will consider as a source of political empowerment is the formation of cross-racial coalitions. This course examins the conditions that make coalitions between African Americans, Latinos and other groups possible. ",

What factors are important in understanding how far you would go? Can evidence from such an experiment provide enough insight into why you may, or may not, be capable of committing acts of genocide? The course goal is to critically analyze experimental social psychology by applying it to the study of human nature and genocide. We will do this by studying classical social psychology paradigms and experiments. We will also engage with theories such as evolutionary psychology, cultural anthropology, Marxist psychology, and critical theoryÂ—allowing us to compare and contrast various ways of studying human behavior. In order to aid us in this journey, we will ask questions such as: What role does human nature play in genocide? Can human nature be discovered by the scientific method? Is human nature today the same as it was 15,000 years ago? Or, could genocide have happened 15,000 years ago?\n\nHSA Writing Intensive: Yes.",

This intrigue has been reshapedÂ—but not lostÂ—with the advent of modern visual surveillance techniques. In this course, we will examine a range of manifestations of the solar eye, paying particular attention to the relationship(s) it bears to reality and the ways in which the solar eye operates in schemes both great and small of confidence and illusion. We will consider works by Plato, Foucault, Ellison and Morrison; documents in government policy; and movies like 'The Fly,' 'Cube,' '9' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. (PRT).

What is the relationship between economic power, social power, and political power? How do gender, racial, class, and other inequalities inform political activity such as obeying laws and voting? Does the state respond to citizens, serve capitalists, or is it used by bureaucrats? Where and how do citizens engage in politics together and try to create change?  \nPolitical sociology addresses these and other questions. Central to political sociology is the question of how power in society is constructed, legitimated, sustained, and challenged. With a primary focus on the United States, the first half of the fall 2021 version of the course will analyze group power and daily life (including #MeToo and white fragility), white nationalism and the Republican party, fascist politics, and the Democratic partyaÂ€Â™s changing relationship to working class concerns. The middle part of the class steps back to examine the notion of democracy and the global eliteaÂ€Â™s ability to coopt resistance through neoliberal ideology. Finally, in the last section of the course students will examine social movements generating radical challenges to current forms of inequality and political power, including Black Lives Matter, the #NoDAPL campaign at Standing Rock, Latinx political power, and the fight for a liveable climate future, specifically examining efforts to promote a Green New Deal. \n",

Through the lenses of art and literature, we will investigate how systems of injustice shape the contours of environmental phenomena. As we survey California environmental issues ranging from wildfires to pollution to housing, we will ask: What is the relationship between storytelling and environmental justice? How can art and literature enable us to imagine radical forms of communion and more equitable, resilient futures? By turning a critical, generative lens on our own surroundings, we will embrace placed-based, experiential learning as we take our own local environment as an object of study so that we may both understand and, hopefully, benefit the environment that the Claremont Colleges call home. As such, the class will include field trips, which may include a few Saturday excursions. Course texts will span disciplines, from speculative film and postcolonial literature to environmental investigative journalism and iphone applications. Assignments will include written, creative, and team-based projects.",

Students will critically engage ideas of performance through the mediums of stage, film, TV, activism, and social media- all sites of Queer Theatre- from the (1920s-present day). By recenerting Queer Trans, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (QTBIPOC) voices and experiences, the course seeks to acknowledge and interrogate institutional erasures, systems of oppression, and practices of privilege as part of the methodology of queer theatre. From Stonewall to HIV/AIDS activism, from Harlem balls to televisual drag shows, queer performance has a long history of taking up Queer Theatre as a site of healing and liberatory praxis.",

Before each assignment, we will spend time discussing the writing process, from brainstorming to making final revisions and acknowledging sources. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from peers by critiquing their written work. There will also be a midterm exam. \nA series of shorter analysis papers will culminate in a longer final paper that will require additional reading and research on a specific political or social issue. This paper should be based on a research question that is meaningful to you personally- something that you feel passionately about. You will investigate what respected scholars have had to say regarding this issue. After weighing the evidence presented within these sources, you will formulate your own position and express it in a scholarly way. \n",

The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as 'Permission of Instructor Required' so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.\n",
